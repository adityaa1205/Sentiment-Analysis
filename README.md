## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. This project aims to classify the sentiment of text data using various machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-project.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-project](https://github.com/adityaa1205/Sentiment-Analysis.git)
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   **streamlit**
   **matplotlib**
   **NLTK**
   
    

## Usage
- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of customer reviews or feedback to understand customer satisfaction.
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Analyze social media posts to gauge public opinion on various topics or events.
- **Market Research:** Assess consumer sentiment towards products or brands to inform marketing strategies.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of text samples labeled with their corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). You can download the dataset from [Dataset Source](#).

- Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory or update the path in the code.

## Model

The project explores different machine learning models including:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Each model is trained and evaluated to find the best performing one for sentiment analysis.
